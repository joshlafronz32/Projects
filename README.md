## Featured Projects:
- [A Moment to Break the Ice](https://github.com/joshlafronz32/Projects/blob/main/library/A%20Moment%20to%20Break%20the%20Ice.pdf): Using logistic regression analysis and bootstrapping hypothesis testing to analyze the truth behind the effect of icing an NFL kicker. The models and tests are built on a dataset I built using BeautifulSoup to scrape play-by-play data from Pro Football Reference.
- [An Imperfect Science of NBA Scouting](https://github.com/joshlafronz32/Projects/blob/main/library/An%20Imperfect%20Science%20of%20NBA%20Scouting.pdf): Using linear models, cross validation, regression analysis, and nonparametric methods to test the scouting theory that college free throw shooting is a superior predictor of NBA three-point shooting than college three-point shooting. Once again, the dataset was built through scraping Basketball Reference.
- [Hype & Humility](https://github.com/joshlafronz32/Projects/blob/main/library/Hype%20%26%20Humility.pdf): An article detailing Virginia Tech guard Neoklis Avdalas's 2025-26 freshman season using data visualizations and film analysis to highlight his ups, downs, and areas to grow. The ACC dataset was built using PlayWright and BeautifulSoup and additional features were created from the raw data.
- [No Such Thing as Free](https://github.com/joshlafronz32/Projects/blob/main/library/No%20Such%20Thing%20as%20Free.pdf): Discussing the decline in Russell Westbrook's free throw shooting through the use of bootstrapping and data visualization. This is one of the more unique datasets I've built; it required scraping NBA play-by-play data separating Westbrook's accuracy on first, second, and third free throws.
- [O'Neal v. The Hack-a-Shaq](https://github.com/joshlafronz32/Projects/blob/main/library/O'Neal%20v.%20The%20Hack-a-Shaq.pdf): Challenging Shaquille O'Neal's claim that he, a poor free throw shooter, was more accurate in playoff and high leverage situations. This article applies the use of bootstrap testing using a dataset that came from scraped NBA play-by-play data looking for clutch situation free throws.
- [Pride Restored](https://github.com/joshlafronz32/Projects/blob/main/library/Pride%20Restored.pdf): Using data visualization and reporting to tell the story of the heights achieved by the 2022-23 Loyola Marymount Lions. This article uses creative bar plots to illustrate the impossiblity of LMU conquering Gonzaga the way they did.
- [The SEC's Secret Shot Chucker](https://github.com/joshlafronz32/Projects/blob/main/library/The%20SEC's%20Secret%20Shot%20Chucker.pdf): Highlighting the volume and inefficiency of Texas A&M guard Zhuric Phelps using feature engineering, visualizations, and other comparative tables. The visualizations were designed in R and Excel, and the data was extracted through SQL queries.
